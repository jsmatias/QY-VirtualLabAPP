## Description

Welcome to our Virtual lab for Upconversion (UC).
Our app is based on a simple general analytical model that introduces
the concept of transition power density points, $\\rho_j$, and QY saturation, $\eta_{sj}$, to characterise the internal Quantum Yield (iQY)
of an UC process originated from an arbitrary $| j \\rangle$ state.
This model is particularly useful for understanding the non-linear power density dependence present in upconverting systems, such as
Upconverting Nanoparticle (UCNPs), which are important for several applications, such as living tissue imaging and super-resolution microscopy.

The general analytical model was derived from a set of rate equation that comprises energy transfer, $W_j$, and linear decay rates, $R_j$, of the electronic
states of sensitizer-activator pair involved in the process called energy transfer upconversion (ETU).
Please check our scientific paper for more details regarding it ([Link to be placed here], DOI:).

Our app allows users to interactively explore the behaviour of the iQY of a upconverting system (a two-level sensitizer coupled to a four-level activator)
under different excitation power densities. Users can change the values of the input parameters of the model and see the
corresponding iQY values and UC luminescence and population densities graphs on the screen.
The app is capable of simulating ETU processes with order higher than two, which has not been widely studied in the literature up to the publishing date
of the paper.

We believe that our web app will be a valuable tool for researchers and scientists interested in studying UCNPs
and the understanding of their behaviour under different excitation conditions.
We hope you find our app useful and informative, and we welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

## Usage

To explore the simulation, simply navigate to the "Simulation" tab in the sidebar on the left.
From there, you can adjust the input parameters and observe how they influence the population densities of the energy states,
which in turn affect the UC luminescence and iQY results.

Use the slider to adjust the excitation power density and input boxes to change the decay and energy transfer rates
of the energy levels involved in the UC process.

st.markdown("""
As you change the parameters, the simulation will automatically update the population densities and the resulting luminescence and iQY values.
You can also observe the changes in real-time on the corresponding graphs.

By exploring the simulation, you can gain insights into the behaviour of upconverting materials under different excitation conditions
and better understand the relationship between the input parameters and the resulting luminescence and iQY values.
